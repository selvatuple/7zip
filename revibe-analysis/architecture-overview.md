## System Architecture

## Architectural Layers

### User Interfaces

This layer provides user-facing clients for interacting with the archiver, including both a graphical file manager and a command-line utility.

### Application Core

Acts as an orchestrator, processing user commands from the UI layer, managing application state, and invoking the underlying archive and codec libraries to perform archiving operations.

### Archive Format API

Defines the public API and data structures for interacting with 7-Zip archives. It abstracts the complexities of the archive structure and coordinates the use of different codecs and filters.

### Codec & Filter Library

Contains the core, low-level implementations of various compression, encryption, and pre-processing filter algorithms. These components are written in C for maximum performance and portability.

### Platform Abstraction & System Services

A cross-cutting layer that provides a consistent interface for interacting with the underlying operating system for tasks like file I/O, memory allocation, and threading, using conditional compilation to switch between platform-specific APIs.
